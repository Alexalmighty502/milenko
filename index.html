		<h2>What is Milenko?</h2>
		<p>
			"Milenko's Bot Detector" is an <strong>"anti-bot bot"</strong> <i>(yes, really...)</i> that helps to remove malicious bots from Team Fortress 2 casual matches by detecting, reporting, votekicking, and killing them in the interim.<br>
			In other words, Milenko bots are "Friendly Botkillers".<br>
			Their name stems from the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU54CvzCwg">"The Great Milenko" by Insane Clown Posse.</a><br>
		</p>

		<h2>What does Milenko do?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Milenko bots join casual matches in Team Fortress 2 and automatically detect malicious bots.</li>
			<li>Milenko bots will join as the spy class and "spycrab" in the spawn room.</li>
			<li>When a malicious bot is detected in a match, Milenko switches to the sniper class and targets these bots.</li>
			<li>Milenko bots will <strong>only kill malicious bots.</strong></li>
			<li>This helps to prevent malicious bots from ruining the fun of innocent players and makes it more obvious when malicious bots are present.</li><br>

			<li>Premium Milenko bots will announce a list of the malicious bots on each team in the chat periodically.</li>
			<li>This makes it <strong>much</strong> easier for teams to coordinate votekicks on malicious bots.</li><br>

			<li>When possible (not on 2 minute votekick cooldown), premium milenko bots will automatically call votekicks against malicious bots on the same team.</li><br>

			<li>They will also inform players in chat <strong>whether or not the player being kicked is a known bot.</strong></li>
			<li>This helps to prevent innocent players from being kicked by malicious bots or other players.</li>
			<li>When a votekick is called, Milenko bots will automatically vote Yes on malicious bots and No on regular players.</li><br>
		</ul>

		<h2>Will Milenko bots leave once all the malicious bots are kicked from the match?</h2>
		<p><strong>Yes, they will.</strong> They stay in every new match for a brief period (about 15 seconds after setup time ends) to detect malicious bots, but they will leave automatically. <strong>You do not need to kick them!</strong></p>

		<h2>How can I tell the difference between Milenko and malicious bots?</h2>
		<p>Milenko bots have some features and behaviors that can help to distinguish them from malicious bots:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>About half of Milenko bots will not wear any cosmetic items due to not being premium.</li>
			<li>When no malicious bots are detected, Milenko bots will "explode" before leaving.</li>
			<li>After killing the last malicious bot on the other team, Milenko bots will taunt with the "Director's Vision".</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Milenko bots that have been upgraded to premium will:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Perform the Disco Fever taunt when they join</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Always wear the Mann Co. hat</strong></li>
			<li>When a malicious bot is detected, Milenko bots will say "Sentry ahead!" every 15 seconds as a warning</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Okay, but what do <i>malicious bots</i> look like?</h2>
		<p>Please read <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1935994199">this guide</a> for more information on how to identify common malicious bots.</p>

		<h2>How can I help get rid of malicious bots?</h2>
		<p>
			You can download <a href="https://github.com/PazerOP/tf2_bot_detector">PazerOP's TF2 Bot Detector</a>, a program that helps to identify malicious bots and automatically kick them.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>We have our own list of malicious bots which you can add to the tool.</strong><br>
			This list is 100% accurate and only contains malicious bots. There is no way for a legitimate player to get added to the list.<br>
			<br>
			You can download Milenko's playerlist <a href="https://incontestableness.github.io/milenko/playerlist.milenko-list.json">here!</a><br>
			Read PazerOP's TF2 Bot Detector <a href="https://github.com/PazerOP/tf2_bot_detector/wiki/Customization#third-party-player-lists">wiki page</a> for information on how to add the list to the tool. (Save the playerlist file and move it to the bot detector "cfg" folder)

		<h2>It costs my time and money to host the Milenko bots. Please consider donating.</h2>
		<p>
			Donations go towards funding development of the project as well as covering hosting costs. <a href="https://ko-fi.com/milenko">Please donate here.</a><br>
			With enough donations, we can migrate to a stable server and run the bots 24/7.<br>
			<br>
			There are currently 10 premium Milenko bots. Premium Milenko bots can call votekicks, use chat to identify malicious bots, and more.<br>
			<ul>
				<li>When there are enough hosting resources, the "Disco Fever" taunt will be bought from the in-game store to upgrade more bots to TF2 premium.</li>
				<li>It costs about $6 in donations ($4.99 + $0.41 tax + ~$0.46 PayPal fees) to upgrade a bot.</li>
			</ul>
			As of 09/05/2020, 13 more bots are due to be upgraded to premium.<br>
			This will take some time, as I have to manually create each email account, steam account, and log in to each and buy a taunt from the in-game store.<br>
			Due to ratelimits and such, this could take multiple weeks.<br>
			<br>
			Bitcoin donations are also welcome: 35ASdQQ55ALDU9NSu2unTcRzYe9LckG6M5<br>
			If your Bitcoin wallet supports it, you should send to this bip32 address instead for reduced transaction fees: bc1q728r5n9mkeege7783tzhqgcayy8s44qwhwllsz
