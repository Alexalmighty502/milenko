		<h2>What is Milenko?</h2>
		<p>
			"Milenko's Bot Detector" is an "anti-bot bot" (yes, really...) that helps to remove malicious bots from Team Fortress 2 casual matches by detecting, reporting, votekicking, and killing them in the interim.<br>
			In other words, Milenko bots are "Friendly Botkillers".<br>
			Their name stems from the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU54CvzCwg">"The Great Milenko" by Insane Clown Posse.</a><br>
		</p>
    
		<h2>Will the botkillers leave once all the malicious bots are kicked from the match?</h2>
		<p><strong>Yes, they will.</strong> They stay in every new match for a brief period (about 10 seconds after setup time ends) to detect malicious bots, but they will leave automatically. <strong>You do not need to kick them!</strong></p>

		<h2>How can I tell the difference between Milenko and malicious bots?</h2>
		<p>Milenko has some unique features and behaviors that can help to distinguish them from malicious bots:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Milenko bots will join as the spy class and "spycrab" in the spawn room.</li>
			<li>When a malicious bot is detected, they will switch to the sniper class and target them.</li>
			<li>Milenko bots will <strong>only kill malicious bots.</strong></li>
			<li>When a votekick is called, Milenko bots will automatically vote Yes on malicious bots and No on regular players.</li>
			<li>Most Milenko bots will not wear any cosmetic items.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Milenko bots that have been upgraded to premium will:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Announce a list of current malicious bots in the chat periodically</li>
			<li>Automatically call votekicks against malicious bots on the same team</li>
			<li>When votekicks are called, they will announce in chat whether that player is a bot</li>
			<li>When a malicious bot is detected, Milenko bots will say "Sentry ahead!" periodically as a warning</li>
			<li>Perform the Disco Fever taunt when they join</li>
			<li>Wear the Mann Co. hat</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>How can I help get rid of malicious bots?</h2>
		<p>
			You can download <a href="https://github.com/PazerOP/tf2_bot_detector">PazerOP's TF2 Bot Detector</a>, a program that helps to identify malicious bots and automatically kick them.<br>
			<strong>We now have our own list of malicious bots which you can add to the tool!</strong> You can <a href="https://incontestableness.github.io/milenko/playerlist.milenko-list.json">download it here!</a><br>
			This list is 100% accurate - there is no way for a legitimate player to get added to the list unless they use a cheat.

		<h2>Hosting the botkillers costs money.</h2>
		<p>
			For every $6 ($4.99 + $0.41 tax + ~$0.46 PayPal fees; extra ~$0.14 goes towards next bot) received, a botkiller can be upgraded to TF2 premium.<br>
			This will allow the bot to call votekicks, use chat to identify malicious bots, and more!<br>
			If you would like to donate directly to the developer, please say so in your message when donating! These donations will be used to cover hosting costs.<br>
			<a href="https://ko-fi.com/milenko">Please consider donating here.</a> All donations are not-for-profit.<br>
			<br>
			Bitcoin donations are also welcome: 35ASdQQ55ALDU9NSu2unTcRzYe9LckG6M5<br>
			Alternatively, you can send to this bip32 address for reduced transaction fees: bc1q728r5n9mkeege7783tzhqgcayy8s44qwhwllsz<br>
			<br>
			Premium Milenko bots: 6<br>
			Number of bots that are due to be upgraded to premium: 17<br>
			This will take some time, as I have to manually create each email account, steam account, and log in to each and buy a taunt from the in-game store.<br>
			Due to ratelimits and such, this could take multiple weeks.
