    <h1>The Great Milenko</h1>

    <h2>What is Milenko?</h2>
    <p>"The Great Milenko" is a bot that attempts to remove malicious bots from Team Fortress 2 casual matches by detecting, reporting, votekicking, and killing them in the interim.</p>
    <p>More specifically, "Milenko" is the name of the project.</p>
    <p>You may have seen Milenko under the name <strong>"Friendly Botkiller".</strong></p>
    <p>The name "The Great Milenko" stems from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU54CvzCwg">the song by Insane Clown Posse.</a></p>
    
    <h2>Will the botkillers leave once all the malicious bots are kicked from the match?</h2>
    <p><strong>Yes, they will.</strong> They stay in every new match for a brief period to detect malicious bots, but they will leave automatically.</p>

    <h2>How can I help get rid of malicious bots?</h2>
    <p>You can download <a href="https://github.com/PazerOP/tf2_bot_detector">PazerOP's TF2 Bot Detector</a>, a program that helps to identify malicious bots and automatically kick them.</p>
    <p><strong>We now have our own list of malicious bots which you can add to the tool!</strong> You can <a href="https://incontestableness.github.io/catlist/milenko-list.json">download it here!</a></p>

    <h2>Hosting the botkillers costs money.</h2>
    <p>For every $10 received, a botkiller can be upgraded to TF2 premium. This will allow the bot to call votekicks and use chat to identify malicious bots.</p>
