		<h2>What is Milenko?</h2>
		<p>
			Milenko is an "anti-bot bot" (yes, really...) that helps to remove malicious bots from Team Fortress 2 casual matches by detecting, reporting, votekicking, and killing them in the interim.<br>
			In other words, Milenko bots are "Friendly Botkillers".<br>
			Their name stems from the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU54CvzCwg">"The Great Milenko" by Insane Clown Posse.</a><br>
			<strong>There have been malicious bots impersonating Milenko under fake names like "mlienko". These bots are not affiliated with the Milenko project.</strong>
		</p>
    
		<h2>Will the botkillers leave once all the malicious bots are kicked from the match?</h2>
		<p><strong>Yes, they will.</strong> They stay in every new match for a brief period (about 30 seconds after setup time ends) to detect malicious bots, but they will leave automatically. <strong>You do not need to kick them!</strong></p>

		<h2>How can I tell the difference between Milenko and malicious bots?</h2>
		<p>Milenko has some unique features and behaviors that can help to distinguish them from malicious bots:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Milenko bots will join as the spy class.</li>
			<li>When a bot is detected, they will switch to the sniper class and look straight up.</li>
			<li>Milenko bots will <strong>only kill malicious bots.</strong></li>
			<li>When a votekick is called, Milenko bots will automatically vote Yes on malicious bots and No on regular players.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Milenko bots that have been upgraded to premium will:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Announce a list of current malicious bots in the chat periodically</li>
			<li>Automatically call votekicks against malicious bots on the same team</li>
			<li>When a malicious bot joins or is first detected, Milenko bots will say "Sentry ahead!" as a warning.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>How can I help get rid of malicious bots?</h2>
